                                (BRIEF) DESCRIPTION

A Python module to inspect and generate metadata for a shapefile that has none...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                   DEPENDENCIES

Python Libraries:

   pyshyp 
   numpy
   xml (should be included in your python packages by default)

Written in python 2.7. Python 3 will probably throw some errors because 
raw_input() has been replaced with just input().

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  USAGE AND NOTES

| Quick Start! |
|______________|

After you have the dependencies, cd into the src directory and then

    $ python inspect_shapefile.py

The program will walk you through some options. After entering the path and name
of your shapefile (or choosing to use a hard-wired path in inspect_shapefile.py), 
you can choose to

    (1) investigate a single record field (type in single)
    (2) generate an xml file (type in xml)
    (3) do both (type in both)

The program will ask you a few more self-evident questions along the way...

If you generated an xml file, open it up in an internet browser and you can 
click through the information tree.

I originally wrote this in order to streamline the process of exploring new 
shapefiles that don't have any corresponding metadata (arg!). When using the 
code, you can either choose a single field from the shapefile records to explore 
or you can generate an xml file for all the fields. "Exploring" a shapefile 
here means finding the name or label of all the records, finding the data
type of each record and generating a sample of some kind for each record. 

The xml file that is generated is not any standard format. It could be improved.
