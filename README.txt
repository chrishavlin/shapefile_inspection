shapefile inspection!

A module to inspect and document a shapefile that you don't have any metadata for. 

Python Dependencies:

pyshyp 
xml.etree (should be included in your python packages by default)

Written in python 2.7. Python 3 will probably throw some errors because 
raw_input() has been replaced with just input().
